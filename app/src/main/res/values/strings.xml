    <string name="titleMain">"Today, on the second National Day of Observance for COVID-19, we take time to
mourn the people we lost, as well as recognize those who got sick, and those who are
still suffering from long COVID-19. This is also the day where we recognize and show
gratitude to our health care workers who sacrificed so much, and spent two years on
the front lines to protect us all. I invite everyone in Canada to reflect on the significant
impacts we have feltâ€•and continue to experience-since the onset of the pandemic,
both in our professional and personal lives."</string>
